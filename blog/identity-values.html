              Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision.
              Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision,
              the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

            <p>
              I once got into an altercation with a coworker who was being
              physically aggressive to me. I had the decision to fight back or
              try to de-escalate the situation. I chose not to fight back as I
              knew that would only escalate the situation further and leave
              myself in a worse position in future. Some might say that this
              would make you look weak but for me there is nothing to gain from
              a fight and I am happy I made the decision to stay calm and avoid
              retaliation because the coworker did eventually calm down and the
              altercation never became serious.

              Describe how your culture and the people around you have

            <p>
              The culture and people around me have influenced my values in a
              way that I follow most of the social norms, and don’t cause much
              trouble.

              Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
              learning journey.
            </h4>
            <p class="m10">
              A strength is the ability to work through defined technical work
              and problem solve in the process. This will support me during my
              learning journey because I will be able to perform the technical
              side of the work more easily and have confidence doing so.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another strength I have is the ability to troubleshoot. This will
              support my journey because at many times I will face errors or
              problems that I dont understand why is happening and I know how to
              exhaust all the options possible to find a solution.

              Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
              development. How might these affect your learning journey?
            </h4>
            <p class="m10">
              A limitation of mine is when the work I have to do becomes too
              open ended, e.g designing, or coming up with ideas for content or
              style of a project. This could affect my learning journey because
              many of the tasks will involve designing or coming up with ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another limitation I have could be the ability to communicate my
              thought process and my understanding with others. I mostly work on
              things myself so I have limited experience communicating my
              knowledge with others. This could affect my learning journey
              because I might need to explain verbally the concepts that I have
              learnt and the knowledge I have regarding the course material.

              Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
              others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies
              you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your
              reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
            </h4>
            <p>
              An example is when playing team sports and your teammates are
              criticizing your actions despite trying to do the best thing in
              the moment. I might try to just focus on my game and ignore it or
              talk to a teammate about it. This strategy isn’t always effective
              so I think the better strategy is to make sure your teammates
              understand how you play and stamp out misunderstandings before the
              game.
