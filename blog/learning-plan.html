            <p>
              My long term goal is to get a career in tech. I am happy for my
              career to involve working with websites or other software.

              A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
              learning
            </h4>
            <p class="m10">
              My strengths are the ability to research and troubleshoot problems
              using methods such as searching the web, debugging, and running
              tests on my local system. I will attempt to gain broader knowledge
              of what I'm working with to further my understanding of the
              problem I am running into.
            </p>
            <p class="m10">
              Another strength is I do lots of research such as looking through
              documentation and videos about topics I am trying to understand
              before I try to implement to material.
            </p>
            <p>
              A weakness I have is that I can often get distracted as on a
              computer you are only one tab away from being distracted by a
              youtube video, music, or other social media.

              A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
              programme. This should include: An explanation of how you will
              manage yourself to work productively and safely with other
              learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives What

            </h4>
            <p class="m10">
              I plan to manage my workload by setting aside a time period in the
              day where I must be focused on studying. Outside of this time
              period should be the opposite, I should not be studying unless it
              is absolutely necessary. I will work productively with other
              learners by planning what work each of us should be doing and
              communicating clearly what I am working on and what work I have
              completed. When I am unsure of something I will ask my pears or
              facilitators for help.
            </p>
            <p>
              When things are building up and starting to get to me I will take
              a short break and review all the things I have to do and in what
              timeframe. I will then set aside extra time in my week to help me
              complete my work. If there does not appear to be time I will talk
              to my facilitators about what can be done or if I could have some
              more time to complete my work.

              I will try and solve problems myself within a set period. If the
              time exceeds that period I will then ask facilitators for help.
