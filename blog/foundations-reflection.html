            <h4>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</h4>
            <ol style="font-size: 18px;" class="g5">
              <li>If I truly believe in myself and maintain a growth mindset I can get anything done.</li>
              <li>That I am less clear on my identity and values than I had realized.</li>
              <li>The strength of my ego is largely determined with how comfortable I am with a problem.</li>

            <h4>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
            <p>Values are important because they dictate why you are learning in the first place how much you
              prioritize learning over other things in life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Empathy is important because you need to understand how the code you write will be understood by other people
              as well as understanding what other people are doing and feeling.
            </p>
            <p>
              Self-awareness is important because you constantly need to tune the way you behave in accordance to how others
              are perceiving you.

            <h4>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h4>
            <p>What surprised me the most was the effectiveness that understanding neuroplasticity and a growth mindset can have on
              your learning. This encourages me to always persist and try my best to understand things.

            <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</h4>
            <p>The most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning was to look within and truly understand what my values
              are, what's my identity, how I will approach my learning plan and then put all that into sentences.

            <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h4>
            <p>I believe the reason for the large focus on human skills is because a large part of career in tech is about how you communicate
              with and express yourself to others. This is important for applying for and getting a job as well as performing well once in a job.

            <h4>Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>
            <p>In some ways I do believe studying human skills the online part of a course is difficult because there is little opportunity to put things into practice outside of 
              digital communication.
