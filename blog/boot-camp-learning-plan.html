            <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>
            <p>My long term goal is to get a career in tech and I hope to use the skills gained the bootcamp to achieve this. I don't have
              a specific destination in mind but any work involving websites or even other types of software is ideal.

            <h4>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h4>
            <p>My biggest strengths in bootcamp will be my ability to understand the technical work and problem solve/trouble shoot where necessary.</p>
            <p>My biggest limitation will probably be my creativity when it comes to ideas for more open ended projects or design.</p>

            <h4>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h4>
            <p>My biggest non-technical challenge and bootcamp could be keeping on top the material and staying focused or learning
              how to work effectively in team.

            <h4>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
            <p>I would like to develop the ability to maintain focus even when things get boring or hard. I would also
              like to develop the ability to work on projects in a team instead of solo.

            <h4>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>
            <p>I expect that the bootcamp team are clear on exactly what they want from us and the work we are required to do. I also expect
              that they are able to help when we are stuck.

            <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h4>
            <p>My expectations of myself are that I complete all my work on time and don't get distracted.</p>
