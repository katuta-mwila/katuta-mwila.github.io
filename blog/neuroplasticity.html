            <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
            <p>Neuroplasticity is about the brain's ability to change and adapt over time, often in response
              to things such as experiences, emotions, or new information. By understanding the principles of
              neuroplasticity people are more motivated to put effort into learning and improving their abilities.
              This is because when people understand their brains are malleable and can be changed with practice 
              and repetition they have more incentive to try and improve. On the contrary if people don't 
              understand neuroplasticity they might fall into the trap of thinking they cannot improve their abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              I will personally engage with the principles of neuroplasticity by understanding that my brain is not in a 
              fixed state and that with enough practice and repetition I can strengthen the neural pathways in my brain. 
              This will benefit me because it will help me to overcome challenges and setbacks whilst motivating me to 
              put effort into improving my understanding of different topics.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are many ways to develop and increase your neuroplasticity.

              <h5>Practice and Repetition</h5>
              <p>Through consistent repetitions, retrieving memories, and reviewing material the brain will develop stronger, 
              thicker, more hard wire connections and pathways.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="g5">
              <h5>Putting information into context</h5>
              <p>This is done by drawing a relationship between learning material/new information and information you 
                already understand in your life. Integrating the material into your life makes it more intuitive and 
                easier to understand as you can immediately see a real life example of the material in use.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="g5">
              <h5>Understanding that neuroplasticity exists</h5>
              <p>Understanding that you are capable of changing your brain increases motivation and removes self imposed
                 barriers when it comes to learning.</p>
            </div>

              <p>Here is a resource I found helpful for learning this material.</p>

            <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
            <p>A growth mindset is a belief that with the right amount of practice, effort, and dedication that intelligence 
              and abilities can be developed and improved over time. When you have a growth mindset you see challenges as an 
              opportunity to learn and are resilient to setbacks. You will do anything to overcome your challenges such as 
              practice, repetition, and asking for help if necessary.</p>
            <p>I was surprised to see the level of improvement that a class can see after being introduced to a growth mindset. 
              A kindergarten class in New York scored in the 95th percentile on a national achievement test after implementing 
              a growth mindset. Another example is a struggling class in the South Bronx became the number one fourth grade 
              class in the whole New York state.</p>
            <p>I will integrate a growth mindset into my learning journey by always believing I can
              improve and grow my abilities, knowledge and understanding. Doing whatever it takes 
              and being patient in my learning journey.
