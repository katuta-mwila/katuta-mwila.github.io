            <h3>What is emotional Intelligence?</h3>
            <p>Emotional intelligence is the ability to monitor, understand, express, and control the emotions of yourself and other people.
              It is the ability to use emotions to communicate with and relate to other people as well as understanding your own emotions.
            </p>
            <p>Some key elements of emotional intelligence are</p>
            <div class="g5">
              <h5>Self Awareness</h5>

            </div>

            </div>
            <div class="g5">
              <h5>Understanding Emotions</h5>
              <p>Understanding why you are feeling a certain emotion as well as understanding why others around you are feeling or expressing an emotion.

            <h3>How is emotional intelligence different from IQ?</h3>
            <p>EQ and IQ measure different cognitive abilities.</p>
            <h5>IQ</h5>
            <p>IQ measures a person's mental ability such as</p>
            <ul class="g5">
              <li><p>Visual and spatial processing</p></li>
              <li><p>Knowledge of the world</p></li>
              <li><p>Fluid reasoning</p></li>
              <li><p>Working memory and short-term memory</p></li>
              <li><p>Quantitative reasoning</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>IQ is measured using standardized tests.</p>
            <p>IQ is considered to be more static and harder to change.</p>
            <h5>EQ</h5>
            <p>EQ measures emotional intelligence and is measured using either self report tests or from the observation of a mental health professional.</p>
            <p>EQ is more malleable and can be improved over time with things such as experience, self-reflection, or practicing mindfulness.</p>

            <h3>Why is emotional intelligence important?</h3>
            <p>Emotional intelligence is important for a variety of reasons.</p>
            <div class="g5">
              <h5>Decision Making</h5>
              <p>Emotional intelligence means improved decision making because you can create a better balance between emotional and logical thinking.
                This involves avoiding impulsive emotion based decisions but at the same time maintaining an understanding of how your decision will
                be perceived from an emotional standpoint.
              </p>
            </div>

              <h5>Mental Health</h5>
              <p>Strong emotional intelligence is good for mental health because you are able to better cope with emotions of stress
                and anxiety.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="g5">
              <h5>Relationships</h5>
              <p>Emotional intelligence is what allows you to navigate and maintain a healthy relationship with other people. This
                involves understanding other people's emotions and how best to communicate with others and express your own emotions. This allows
                you to cooperate more effectively with others which is particularly good if you are in a leadership position.
