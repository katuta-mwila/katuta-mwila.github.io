            <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
            <p>In this blog post I will be talking about problem solving. I will discuss times I was blocked on a simple problem and times I
              elegantly solved a problem. I will also be reflecting on how confident I felt using different problem solving techniques and
              about a time I was reluctant to ask for help.

            <h3>A time I was stuck on a simple problem</h3>
            <p>A time I was stuck on a simple problem was in a coding challenge where I had to capitalize the first letter of every word
              in a sentence. A problem solving technique I used was to closely look at the output of my code and try to match it with the code itself
              so that I could see why my code is producing the wrong output. Another technique I used was to take a closer look at the documentation for
              pieces of code I was using to make sure I didn't have any misunderstandings. I learned from this process that even when you believe that you
              have solved a problem the correct way there are often many mistakes with your logic that need to be corrected.

            <h3>A time I elegantly solved a problem</h3>
            <p>My problem was that the fans on my computer's graphics card were stuck at 100% speed and were extremely loud. The first
              thing I tried was to research and diagnose the problem through searching websites like google and youtube. This failed
              so my next step was to simply remove the fans from the graphics card and use no fans. This brings the obvious consequence
              of overheating if I did anything intensive on my computer. After doing more research I came to the conclusion that I could
              attach a spare cpu fan to my graphics card using cable ties then use software to adjust the speed of this fan manually.
              This was a frustrating problem to overcome because no amount of research was helping me solve the problem and I thought I might
              have to buy a new graphics card. I learned that even in today's age with all the access to information we have that some problems
              are so niche that even the internet can fail to provide a clean solution to a problem.

            <h3>Reflecting on how confident I am using different problem solving techniques</h3>
            <div class="g5">
              <h5>Pseudocode</h5>
              <p>I am confident with pseudocode however I prefer to write a list of things I expect a piece of code to perform rather
                then to write all the steps for the code.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="g5">
              <h5>Trying something</h5>
              <p>I am confident in trying something because usually by trying something I get a clearer picture of the problem then
                when it's all in my head. It also gives me more context for how a solution should be designed in the context of a coding language.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="g5">
              <h5>Rubber ducky method</h5>
              <p>I am not confident about this method and never use it as I believe there are other methods that work better for me.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="g5">
              <h5>Reading error messages</h5>
              <p>I like to read error messages because they show me exactly where to look when fixing a problem in my code.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="g5">
              <h5>Console.logging</h5>
              <p>
                I find console.logging useful because I can view the outputs of various parts of code and compare it with what I expect the output
                should look like if I coded everything correctly.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="g5">
              <h5>Googling</h5>
              <p>I am confident with googling because I know how to write my searches in ways that get the results I'm looking for and with the amount of
                information on the internet there is almost always a solution somewhere.

            <div class="g5">
              <h5>Asking your peers for help</h5>
              <p>I am confident in asking peers for help.</p>

              <h5>Improving your process with reflection</h5>
              <p>After I have an initial solution I am happy to reflect on it and refine it if necessary.</p>

            <h3>Reflecting on a time I was reluctant to ask for help</h3>
            <p>A time I was reluctant to ask for help was in school. I think I was reluctant sometimes because I didn't want
              to look like I didn't know something or I thought I should be able to figure things out without help. I know now that if
              I'm ever stuck with something to ask for help if necessary.
